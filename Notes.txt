Problems

1. The current issue with the 7 day forecast is the following

2. Dates are not updated into the graph. Can I integrate dates into the training?

3. The final 7 predictions to the 7 day forecast seems to be missing. Could that be an issue with how the 
data is split and divided? 

4. One consideration I didn't think of. I have it configured so that a time series of 20 is used to predict 1 to 7 days ahead. 
I only properly recorded the days for seven days ahead. How do i account foe this in the other days? 

5. I need to see how dates are handled considering that each prediction has seven dates, ranging from 1 to seven days into the future. 

6. Im sure the dates are incorrect due to this seven day b.s.

7. How is mean suared error calcualted. Will ask chat gpt about this. --> done

8. Can i calcualte RMSE for all seven days? --> done 

9. Im thinking that the implementation in which only the seventh day variable is predicted might be more accurate than its 7 day
individual implementation. 

10. I just Realized!, is the training happening to all seven dates? That could explain the odd skewing thats occuring
if the training is happening on one date.

Solutions

1. before i solve problem 3, let's see if i can put the dates appropriately into the graph. Then i will go about solving problem
2 to solve the last values of the graph.

2a. To solve the issue between problems 4 to 6, I need to record the dates for 7 outcomes ranging from 1 to 7. 
I'm thinking maybe i need to apply data structures of data structures. 
One data structure will house the last day of the look back sequence, and then conncected to that date, would be the following 
seven predicted dates. 

2b. First, lets ask chatgpt to see what solution it should implement by pasting the function, and bringing up the fact that only the 
final of the seven dates are being recorded. If it doesn't make something good, then i will apply 2c.

2c. Have chatgpt apply the solution from 2a.
