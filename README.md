# Stock Price Prediction Project

## 1. Project Concept and Scope
### Objective
Predict future stock prices based on historical data.

### Scope
Focus on a specific market sector or a set of companies for a more targeted approach.

## 2. Data Collection
- Utilize APIs such as Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or Quandl for historical stock price data.
- Gather comprehensive data including prices, volumes, and market indicators.

## 3. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values and outliers.
- Perform normalization or standardization.
- Feature engineering: Implement moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), etc.

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Employ Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Visualize trends, patterns, and correlations in the data.

## 5. Model Selection
- **Time Series Models**: ARIMA, SARIMA for univariate forecasting.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines.
- **Deep Learning Models**: LSTM networks.

## 6. Model Training and Validation
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Use TimeSeriesSplit in scikit-learn for cross-validation.

## 7. Performance Metrics
- Evaluate using MSE, MAE, and RMSE.
- Include financial metrics like the Sharpe Ratio.

## 8. Feature Importance and Model Interpretation
- Use SHAP for model interpretation and understanding feature impact.

## 9. Deployment and Monitoring
- Deploy the model on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP.
- Implement a real-time monitoring dashboard using Dash or Streamlit.
- Set up continuous model training with new data.

## 10. Documentation and Presentation
- Document code, model choices, and findings comprehensively.
- Include a detailed README with instructions and results.

## 11. Ethical Considerations and Compliance
- Address ethical issues and compliance with financial regulations.

## 12. Future Work and Improvements
- Explore incorporating news sentiment analysis or advanced algorithms.
