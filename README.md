# Stock Price Prediction Project

## 1. **Project Concept and Scope**
Objective: Predict future stock prices based on historical data.
Scope: Focus on a specific market sector or a set of companies for a more targeted approach.

## 2. **Data Collection**
- Use APIs like Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or Quandl to collect historical stock price data.
- Gather sufficient data for meaningful analysis, including prices, volumes, and market indicators.

## 3. **Data Preprocessing**
- Handle missing values, outliers, and perform normalization or standardization.
- Feature engineering: Derive features like moving averages, relative strength index (RSI).

## 4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Use Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for EDA.
- Visualize trends, patterns, and correlations in the data.

## 5. **Model Selection**
- Time Series Models: ARIMA, SARIMA.
- Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines.
- Deep Learning Models: LSTM networks.

## 6. **Model Training and Validation**
- Split the data into training and testing sets, considering the sequential nature of time series data.
- Use TimeSeriesSplit in scikit-learn for cross-validation.

## 7. **Performance Metrics**
- Use metrics like MSE, MAE, and RMSE for evaluation.
- Consider financial metrics like the Sharpe Ratio.

## 8. **Feature Importance and Model Interpretation**
- Employ SHAP for model interpretation.

## 9. **Deployment and Monitoring**
- Deploy the model using AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
- Implement a dashboard using Dash or Streamlit for real-time monitoring.
- Set up continuous model training with new data.

## 10. **Documentation and Presentation**
- Document your code, model choices, and findings on GitHub.
- Create a README file explaining the project, code, and results.

## 11. **Ethical Considerations and Compliance**
- Address ethical considerations and financial regulations compliance.

## 12. **Future Work and Improvements**
- Suggest improvements like incorporating news sentiment analysis.
