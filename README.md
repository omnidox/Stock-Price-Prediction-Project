# Stock Price Prediction Project

## Introduction
This project focuses on predicting future stock prices based on historical data. Utilizing various machine learning techniques, the aim is to forecast stock prices for a specific market sector or a set of companies, providing valuable insights for investors and financial analysts.

## Data Collection
- Historical stock price data is collected using APIs like Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or Quandl.
- Data includes prices, volumes, and other market indicators.

## Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values and outliers.
- Normalization or standardization of data.
- Feature engineering to derive additional insights (e.g., moving averages, RSI).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Analysis includes identifying trends, patterns, and correlations in the dataset.

## Model Selection
- **Time Series Models**: ARIMA, SARIMA.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines.
- **Deep Learning Models**: LSTM networks.

## Model Training and Validation
- Data is split into training and testing sets.
- TimeSeriesSplit in scikit-learn is used for cross-validation.

## Performance Metrics
- Evaluation using MSE, MAE, and RMSE.
- Financial metrics like the Sharpe Ratio are considered for risk-adjusted returns.

## Feature Importance and Model Interpretation
- SHAP values are used to interpret the modelâ€™s predictions.

## Deployment and Monitoring
- Model deployed on cloud services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
- Real-time monitoring and predictions through Dash or Streamlit dashboards.
- Continuous model training setup with new data.

## Documentation and Presentation
- Comprehensive documentation of the code, model choices, and findings.
- Detailed README explaining the project objectives, methodology, and results.

## Ethical Considerations and Compliance
- Discussion on ethical considerations and adherence to financial regulations.

## Future Work and Improvements
- Suggestions for incorporating news sentiment analysis and advanced algorithms.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Dash/Streamlit
- **APIs for Data**: Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance
- **Deployment**: AWS/Azure/GCP, Docker
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
